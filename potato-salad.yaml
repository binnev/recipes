name: Potato salad
author: Robin Neville

ingredients:
  - 1, kg, floury potatoes
  - 3, eggs; hard boiled
  - 1, red onion; very finely chopped
  - apple cider / red wine vinegar
  - 8, small pickles; finely chopped
  - 3, tbsp, mayonnaise
  - 2, tsp, whole-grain mustard
  - 5, sprigs, dill

method:
  - peel and chop the potatoes into small-ish (2-3cm) chunks.
  - boil the potatoes in well salted water until they are cooked through
  - drain the potatoes and rough them up in the colander. Leave them to cool as long as possible. This will help them absorb dressing.
  - hard-boil the eggs (~10m) and let them cool
  - macerate the finely chopped red onion in the vinegar for at least 10m
  - prepare the dressing. Combine mayonnaise, chopped pickles, red onion (drained), dill, mustard, and a splash of pickle juice. Salt and pepper to taste. Add just a pinch of turmeric for the yellow colour. The dressing shouldn't be too thick -- it needs to coat the potatoes evenly.
  - combine the potatoes, eggs, and dressing
  - If you can, pop it in the fridge -- it gets better with time.
