notes: Why I'm cooking so good!
serves: 2-3

ingredients:
  - spaghetti
  - 1, handful, guanciale; diced
  - 3, eggs
  - 50, g, pecorino

method:
  - Prepare the egg mixture; mix 3 egg yolks with the grated pecorino and a generous grind of black pepper
  - Put the spaghetti on to boil in a pan of salted water
  - Dice the guanciale and fry it until the fat renders down (don't put oil in the pan)
  - When the spaghetti is nearly al dente, lower the heat right down on the guanciale and transfer the spaghetti into the frying pan.
  - Add a little bit of the pasta water to emulsify and make cream. Add the egg mixture, being careful to keep it moving so as not to scramble the eggs.
  - Serve with a generous grating of pecorino and black pepper
