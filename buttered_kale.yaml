ingredients: 
- 500, g, kale
- 40, g, butter
- 1, clove, garlic
- 1, pinch, red chilli flakes
- 1, lemon

method: 
- Trim and discard the tough stalks from the kale and roughly chop the leaves. Rinse well, then shake dry.
- Melt the butter in a large heavy-based frying pan and gently fry the garlic, chilli flakes and lemon zest with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper for 3-4 minutes until soft but not browned. Add the kale and stir for about 5 minutes over a medium heat until just wilted. Add a little of the lemon juice, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
