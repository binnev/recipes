Servings: 4

Preparation: 15 minutes

Cooking: 20 minutes

## Equipment: 
- Heavy skillet

## Ingredients:
- [ ] 5 tbsp thai green curry paste
- [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
- [ ] Vegetable oil
- [ ] 250 ml chicken stock
- [ ] 400 ml coconut milk
- [ ] 2 tsp fish sauce
- [ ] 2 tsp sugar
- [ ] 6 kaffir lime leaves
- [ ] 350 g chicken thigh
- [ ] 1 aubergine, thinly sliced
- [ ] 250 g green beans
- [ ] 16 thai basil leaves
- [ ] 1 lime, half the juice
- [ ] Green chillies to taste
- [ ] Rice

## Method:
1. Heat oil in a heavy based skillet or pot over medium high heat.
2. Add curry paste (and garlic, ginger and lemongrass Extras, if using) and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until it mostly "dries out" - see video. Don't breath in the fumes!!
3. Add chicken broth and coconut milk, mix to dissolve paste.
4. Add 1 tsp fish sauce, 1 tsp sugar, no salt.
5. Add kaffir lime leaves. Mix then bring to simmer.
6. Add chicken, stir then lower heat to medium so it's bubbling gently. Cook 7 minutes.
7. Add aubergines, cook 5 minutes until soft.
8. Taste sauce. Add fish sauce or salt for more saltiness, sugar for sweetness.
9. Add beans, cook 2 minutes until a bit softened, then stir through basil and lime juice. Sauce should have reduced but will still be a be on the thin side, not thick - that's how it's should be. DO NOT keep simmering - sauce will darken.
10. Serve curry over jasmine rice with garnishes of choice.
