# Potato salad

Author: Robin Neville

## Ingredients:
- [ ] 1 kg floury potatoes
- [ ] 3 eggs, hard boiled
- [ ] 1 red onion, very finely chopped
- [ ] apple cider / red wine vinegar
- [ ] 8 small pickles, finely chopped
- [ ] 3 tbsp mayonnaise
- [ ] 2 tsp whole-grain mustard
- [ ] 5 sprigs dill

## Method:
1. peel and chop the potatoes into small-ish (2-3cm) chunks.
2. boil the potatoes in well salted water until they are cooked through
3. drain the potatoes and rough them up in the colander. Leave them to cool as long as possible. This will help them absorb dressing.
4. hard-boil the eggs (~10m) and let them cool
5. macerate the finely chopped red onion in the vinegar for at least 10m
6. prepare the dressing. Combine mayonnaise, chopped pickles, red onion (drained), dill, mustard, and a splash of pickle juice. Salt and pepper to taste. Add just a pinch of turmeric for the yellow colour. The dressing shouldn't be too thick -- it needs to coat the potatoes evenly.
7. combine the potatoes, eggs, and dressing
8. If you can, pop it in the fridge -- it gets better with time.
