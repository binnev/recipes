Preparation: 30 minutes

Cooking: 60 minutes

## Ingredients:
- [ ] 1 carrot
- [ ] 1 onion
- [ ] 1 stalk celery
- [ ] 100 g pancetta
- [ ] 500 g minced beef

## Method:
1. Make the "sofrito" -- finely chop the onion, celery, pancetta, and fry it together until it is soft
2. Brown the mince
3. Add half a glass of red wine
4. Dilute the tomato paste with some stock, and add them to the pan
5. Heat low; cook for about an hour
6. Sit in the sun; contemplate how to serve it
7. If you made pasta, combine it with the ragu in a separate pan so that the pasta can soak up the flavours.
