## Ingredients:
- [ ] 1.5 kg riblap
- [ ] 4 onions
- [ ] 2 bay leaves
- [ ] 6 cloves
- [ ] Red wine vinegar
- [ ] 3 tbsp flour
- [ ] Butter
- [ ] 2 slices ontbijtkoek
- [ ] 600 ml beef stock
- [ ] 1.5 kg potatoes
- [ ] Dijon mustard
- [ ] 1 red cabbage, finely sliced
- [ ] 200 ml vinegar
- [ ] 3 tbsp sugar

## Method:
1. Bring equal parts water and vinegar to a boil with some sugar and salt.
2. Finely slice the red cabbage in strips and add to a mason jar. Pour over the liquid, add a bay leaf, chili flakes or any other spices. Close and let marinated for as long as possible
3. Season both sides of the beef with salt, pepper and flour. Sear in a pan with butter and set aside.
4. Slice the onion in thin half rings and add to the same pan. Fry down for 5-10 minutes.
5. Add the flour, tomato paste, red wine vinegar, bay leaves, cloves, beef stock and salt and pepper to taste. 4. Bring to a light simmer and add the beef back, cover and let simmer for at least 3-4 hours or until it falls apart (the longer the better).
6. Make mashed potato
7. When the beef is almost done, stir the ontbijtkoek through it. This will make the sauce thick.
8. Serve with the mash, pickles, any vegetables you like and top with some fresh parsley.
