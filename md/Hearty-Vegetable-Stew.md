1. chop the carrot, celery, garlic, and onions very finely

4. Add the mushrooms and cook on medium high heat until they lose their liquid.
5. Add the rosemary and oregano
6. Add the wine and deglaze any brown spots on your pan
7. Add the rest of the broth, tinned tomatoes, and tomato puree
8. Add the potatoes and turn the heat up to the boil
9. Add the vinegar and salt and pepper to taste
10. Once it's boiling, turn down the heat to low and add the peas
11. Stir the cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold water and add if the stew needs thickening
12. Simmer to desired consistency
