## Ingredients:
- [ ] 800 g chicken
- [ ] 2 tbsp ghee or vegetable oil
- [ ] 4 dried Kashmiri chillies
- [ ] A few green cardamom pods
- [ ] 1 tbsp garlic paste
- [ ] 1 tbsp ginger paste
- [ ] 1 tbsp tomato paste
- [ ] 2 green chilli peppers, finely chopped
- [ ] 1 tbsp cumin powder
- [ ] 1 tbsp coriander powder
- [ ] 2 tbsp Madras curry powder
- [ ] 1 tsp turmeric
- [ ] 2 tbsp red chilli powder
- [ ] 750 ml base curry sauce, heated
- [ ] 2 tbsp mango chutney
- [ ] Fresh coriander
- [ ] A pinch of garam masala (Optional)

## Method:
1. For best results, always warm your curry sauce before adding it to the curry.
2. Heat the ghee/oil over medium heat in a large pan or wok.
3. Add the dried chillies and cardamoms and allow to sizzle for about 30 seconds.
4. Scoop in the garlic and ginger pastes, the tomato paste and the chopped chilli peppers.
5. Allow them to sizzle for about 15 seconds and then add the cumin, coriander powder, chilli powder, curry powder and turmeric.
6. Stir to combine.
7. Now pour in the heated curry sauce and mango chutney. The ingredients should spit their approval in the hot pan.
8. Add the chicken pieces and allow to simmer for about three minutes. If you slow cooked your chicken, you could add a tablespoon or two of the broth for extra flavour.
9. Test for seasoning and add a little salt and pepper.
10. Sprinkle with the fresh coriander and serve.
11. A teaspoon of garam masala sprinkled over the top at the end of cooking is a nice touch!
