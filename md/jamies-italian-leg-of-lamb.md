## Ingredients:
- [ ] 1.5 kg leg of lamb
- [ ] 1 jar kalamata olives
- [ ] 4 fillet anchovies
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic
- [ ] Rosemary
- [ ] 3 red onions, sliced into strips
- [ ] 1 splash red wine
- [ ] Flour
- [ ] Chicken stock

## Method:
1. Chop the garlic and anchovies, and break the rosemary into small sprigs.
2. Cut some shallow holes in the lamb (along the fatty white bits) and stuff a little bit of garlic, anchovy, and rosemary in there.
3. Chop the onions into strips, and put them in the baking tray (under the lamb) along with any leftover garlic, anchovy, and rosemary.
4. When cooked, remove the lamb, and put the baking tray of onions on the hob. Add a heaped tablespoon of flour, a splash of red wine, and some chicken stock to make the gravy.
