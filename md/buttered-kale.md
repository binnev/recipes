## Ingredients:
- [ ] 500 g kale
- [ ] 40 g butter
- [ ] 1 clove garlic
- [ ] 1 pinch red chilli flakes
- [ ] 1 lemon

## Method:
1. Trim and discard the tough stalks from the kale and roughly chop the leaves. Rinse well, then shake dry.
2. Melt the butter in a large heavy-based frying pan and gently fry the garlic, chilli flakes and lemon zest with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper for 3-4 minutes until soft but not browned. Add the kale and stir for about 5 minutes over a medium heat until just wilted. Add a little of the lemon juice, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
