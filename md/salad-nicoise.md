Preparation: 20 minutes

Cooking: 10 minutes

## Equipment: 
- Pestle and mortar

## Ingredients:
- [ ] 3 eggs, semi-soft boiled
- [ ] 4 anchovies
- [ ] 1 tbsp capers
- [ ] 100 g green beans, tips trimmed
- [ ] 300 g small waxy potatoes
- [ ] 1 tbsp dijon mustard
- [ ] 1 clove garlic, crushed
- [ ] 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
- [ ] Olive oil
- [ ] Flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
- [ ] 2 baby gem lettuce, cut into halves and separated
- [ ] 1 can tuna, drained
- [ ] 200 g baby plum tomatoes, chopped in half
- [ ] Kalamata olives (or nicoise if you can get them)

## Method:
1. Boil eggs until semi-soft (7.5 minutes from fridge). Cool in cold water.
2. Boil the potatoes and beans. Season them while they're still warm with salt and olive oil, so they absorb more flavour.
3. Prepare the dressing; combine mustard, anchovies, capers into a paste. Add garlic, black pepper, red wine vinegar, olive oil.
4. Combine the potatoes, beans, lettuce, olives, tomatoes and the dressing. Put a bit of dressing on the bottom so that everything is covered.
