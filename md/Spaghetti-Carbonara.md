Notes: Why I'm cooking so good!
## Ingredients:
- [ ] spaghetti
- [ ] 1 handful guanciale, diced
- [ ] 3 eggs
- [ ] 50 g pecorino
## Method:
1. Prepare the egg mixture; mix 3 egg yolks with the grated pecorino and a generous grind of black pepper
2. Put the spaghetti on to boil in a pan of salted water
3. Dice the guanciale and fry it until the fat renders down (don't put oil in the pan)
4. When the spaghetti is nearly al dente, lower the heat right down on the guanciale and transfer the spaghetti into the frying pan.
5. Add a little bit of the pasta water to emulsify and make cream. Add the egg mixture, being careful to keep it moving so as not to scramble the eggs.
6. Serve with a generous grating of pecorino and black pepper
