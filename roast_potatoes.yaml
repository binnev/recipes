ingredients: 
- 1.5, kg, potatoes (maris piper)
- 300, ml, vegetable oil (or duck/goose fat)
- 8, clove, garlic
- 4, sprig, rosemary

method: 
- Peel the potatoes and cut them into even-sized pieces. Put them in a pan of water and bring to the boil, then simmer until they are just starting to soften. Remove with a slotted spoon and put them first on a wire rack to cool, then in the fridge.
- Heat the oven to 180C (200C non-fan). Spoon the fat into a roasting tin and heat in the oven. Once it’s hot, carefully add the potatoes so you don’t get splashed by the fat.
- Season the potatoes with salt and cook in the oven for 20 minutes. Add the garlic and rosemary and stir them through the potatoes, then continue to roast for about 45 minutes. Once the potatoes are golden and crisp, remove from the fat with a slotted spoon and sprinkle with a little more salt. Serve.
- The trick to the best roast potatoes is not parboiling them with a lid on, draining and then shaking them in the pot. What you want to do is boil them until cooked all the way through, then lift them out of the water and leave on a cake rack to cool. You can do this in advance and keep them in the fridge. On the big day, all you need to do is roast them up and concentrate on making them crispy. It’s one way to make the whole process a little easier, and that’s the key to a successful Christmas.
