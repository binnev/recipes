equipment: 
  - two large cooking pots
  - slotted spoon
  - sieve

ingredients:
  - 2, kg, chicken thighs (or whole chicken)
  - 2, white onion; cut into quarters
  - 2, whole head of garlic; chopped in two horizontally
  - 2, carrots
  - 8, stalks, celery
  - 4, sprigs, fresh thyme
  - 2, bay leaves
  - fresh chives
  - crusty bread

method: 
  - Add the chicken and other ingredients into the pot, and cover with cold water
  - Use a medium heat to bring the water to the boil. As soon as you see bubbles, turn the heat down as low as possible. You want to try and simmer this as gently as possible, because boiling the chicken too hard makes the broth cloudy. Cover with a lid. 
  - After about 1 hour, or when the chicken is cooked through and falling off the bone, remove the chicken and veggies with a slotted spoon. 
  - Set the chicken and carrots aside to cool. 
  - Sieve the soup into another pot. Discard all veg that isn't carrots. 
  - Skim the fat from the top of the soup. Use a ladle and push it gently into the surface so only the top layer of liquid flows into it. Put the oily water into a clear jug so it is easier to see the fat layer. 
  - Chop the carrots into slices or strips. 
  - Pull the chicken meat off the bone and tear into chunks. Save the skins.
  - Replace the meat and carrots back into the broth. Heat through on a medium heat.
  - Serve with chopped chives at the last minute. 
  - (Optional) fry the chicken skins crispy and serve with the crusty bread.
