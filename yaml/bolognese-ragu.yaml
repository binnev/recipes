ingredients:
  - 1, carrot
  - 1, onion
  - 1, stalk, celery
  - 100, g, pancetta
  - 500, g, minced beef
  - 500, g, minced pork
  - 0.5, glass, red wine
  - 1, tbsp, tomato paste
  - 500, ml, stock
  - pecorino

method:
  - Make the "sofrito" -- finely chop the onion, celery, pancetta, and fry it together until it is soft
  - Brown the mince
  - Add half a glass of red wine
  - Dilute the tomato paste with some stock, and add them to the pan
  - Heat low; cook for about an hour
  - Sit in the sun; contemplate how to serve it
  - If you made pasta, combine it with the ragu in a separate pan so that the pasta can soak up the flavours.
