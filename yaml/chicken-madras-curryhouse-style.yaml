ingredients: 
  - 800, g, chicken
  - 2, tbsp, ghee or vegetable oil
  - 4, dried Kashmiri chillies
  - A few green cardamom pods
  - 1, tbsp, garlic paste
  - 1, tbsp, ginger paste
  - 1, tbsp, tomato paste
  - 2, green chilli peppers; finely chopped
  - 1, tbsp, cumin powder
  - 1, tbsp, coriander powder
  - 2, tbsp, Madras curry powder
  - 1, tsp, turmeric
  - 2, tbsp, red chilli powder
  - 750, ml, base curry sauce; heated 
  - 2, tbsp, mango chutney
  - Fresh coriander 
  - A pinch of garam masala (Optional)

method: 
  - For best results, always warm your curry sauce before adding it to the curry.
  - Heat the ghee/oil over medium heat in a large pan or wok.
  - Add the dried chillies and cardamoms and allow to sizzle for about 30 seconds.
  - Scoop in the garlic and ginger pastes, the tomato paste and the chopped chilli peppers.
  - Allow them to sizzle for about 15 seconds and then add the cumin, coriander powder, chilli powder, curry powder and turmeric.
  - Stir to combine.
  - Now pour in the heated curry sauce and mango chutney. The ingredients should spit their approval in the hot pan.
  - Add the chicken pieces and allow to simmer for about three minutes. If you slow cooked your chicken, you could add a tablespoon or two of the broth for extra flavour.
  - Test for seasoning and add a little salt and pepper.
  - Sprinkle with the fresh coriander and serve.
  - A teaspoon of garam masala sprinkled over the top at the end of cooking is a nice touch!
