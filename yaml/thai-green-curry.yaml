cook_minutes: 20
ingredients:
  - 5, tbsp, thai green curry paste
  - 2, cloves, garlic; minced
  - vegetable oil
  - 250, ml, chicken stock
  - 400, ml, coconut milk
  - 2, tsp, fish sauce
  - 2, tsp, sugar
  - 6, kaffir lime leaves
  - 350, g, chicken thigh
  - 1, aubergine; thinly sliced
  - 250, g, green beans
  - 16, thai basil leaves
  - 1 lime; half the juice
  - green chillies to taste
  - rice
method:
  - Heat oil in a heavy based skillet or pot over medium high heat.
  - Add curry paste (and garlic, ginger and lemongrass Extras, if using) and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until it mostly "dries out" - see video. Don't breath in the fumes!!
  - Add chicken broth and coconut milk, mix to dissolve paste.
  - Add 1 tsp fish sauce, 1 tsp sugar, no salt.
  - Add kaffir lime leaves. Mix then bring to simmer.
  - Add chicken, stir then lower heat to medium so it's bubbling gently. Cook 7 minutes.
  - Add aubergines, cook 5 minutes until soft.
  - Taste sauce. Add fish sauce or salt for more saltiness, sugar for sweetness.
  - Add beans, cook 2 minutes until a bit softened, then stir through basil and lime juice. Sauce should have reduced but will still be a be on the thin side, not thick - that's how it's should be. DO NOT keep simmering - sauce will darken.
  - Serve curry over jasmine rice with garnishes of choice.
equipment:
  - heavy skillet
