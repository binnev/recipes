prep time: 20 minutes
cooking time: 90 minutes

ingredients: 
  - 3, tennis ball sized cooking onions; finely sliced
  - 50, ml, vegetable oil or ghee
  - 3, cloves,  garlic; smashed in their skins
  - 1, tsp,  ginger paste
  - 1, inch, carrot; peeled and chopped
  - 0.25, cup,  cabbage; shredded
  - 0.25, red bell pepper; diced
  - 2, tomatoes; finely chopped
  - 1, tbsp, ghee
  - 1, pinch, turmeric
  - 1, tsp, cumin powder
  - 1, tsp, coriander powder
  - 1, tsp, ground fenugreek seeds
  - 1, tsp, smoked paprika

method: 
  - Place the ginger and garlic with a drop of the water in a blender and pulverize to a smooth paste. Set aside.
  - Now pour the oil/ghee into a large heavy bottomed saucepan and heat until bubbling.
  - Throw in the sliced onions, bell pepper, carrot and cabbage and cook slowly over a medium heat in the oil.
  - Allow the vegetables to fry - stirring occasionally for about 20 minutes. You want to brown the vegetable lightly but not burn them.
  - When the onions are translucent and soft, add the ginger and garlic mixture the rest of the spices except for the turmeric.
  - Finally, add the tomatoes and just enough water to cover the vegetables.
  - Bring to a boil and then place the lid on the pan and turn the temperature down to low.
  - Simmer for about 15 minutes. As you do this, a froth will rise to the top. This is okay. No need to skim.
  - After 15 minutes, remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
  - For a smoother sauce, popular in many Indian takeaways, simply blend for about two minutes. It is perfectly good unblended though.
  - Once your sauce is to your liking, melt the ghee in a frying pan. Add the turmeric powder. It will darken as it cooks. You want to brown it for about a minute.
  - Now add the turmeric/ghee mixture to the sauce and bring to a simmer again. Once it is bubbling away, turn down the heat and simmer for a further 15 minutes. Stop simmering if the sauce becomes too thick.
  - Use immediately or store in the fridge for up to four days.
